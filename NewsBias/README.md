**Python based data analysis study of The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reporting on presidential candidates in the 2020 election.** 

The study scraped 6 months of tweets posted by the new outlets which mentioned the candidates Joe Biden and/or Bernie Sanders. Utilizing the VADER NLTK, the emotional valence scores of the articles discussing the aforementioned candidates were analyzed and aggregated into a dataset. Then this dataset was further investigated using Pandas. 

The findings of the analysis are summarized in the news-bias.pdf file. 
The code for the analysis may be found in the NewsBias.ipynb python notebook file.
